# Perfabs And Triggers
[itch.io](https://alon5564.itch.io/prefabs-and-triggers)

* Task 3 Part A
* I implemented section 1, I changed the boundaries of the game to a round world on the horizontal axis and a closed world on the vertical axis.
* In addition, I added a reward to the player that appears at the beginning of the game and when the player collides with it, the player's score is doubled for 5 seconds.
* The scene where I made the change is called d-shield and is located in Asserts\Scripts\3-triggers
